NoSQL database technology is a database type that stores information in JSON documents instead of columns and rows used by relational databases. 
2//
NoSQL databases are built to be flexible, scalable, Zero Downtime, and capable of rapidly responding 
3//
 the four main types of NoSQL databases:
Document databases.
Key-value stores.
Column-oriented databases.
Graph databases.

The presence of four components — atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability — can ensure that a database transaction is completed in a timely manner. When databases possess these components, they are said to be ACID-compliant

The CAP theorem (also called Brewer's theorem) states that a distributed database system can only guarantee two out of these three characteristics: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
